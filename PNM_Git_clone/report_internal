"" this documment is my report for my time interning at Siemens. updated weekly ""

In the first week of my time at Siemens mobility AG, was the onboarding where I was familiaraised with the company grounds, company rules, my colleagues as well as my work station. For thew most part I was educated on where I need to go for certain queries, as well as who I would need to speak with concerning said queries. In addition to that, I was given a work computer which I was tasked with setting up both my credentials to garner Local Admin Rights and a developer environment for the IXL project. It took a week to conclude the formalities mentioned above, including setting up my work station as there were complication with the onboarding that caused the entire process to be drawn out longer than expected. Nevertheless, by the end of week 1, it was a partial success in the sense that I was finally able to access the basic software needed for everyday low level activities.

Shortly after week two commenced, I was assigned my first task. This assignment was to familiarize myself with theory governing the framework for setting up the baseline measurement algorithms.
