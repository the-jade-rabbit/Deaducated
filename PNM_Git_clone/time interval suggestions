""One possible way to implement a time interval counter in Python that resets every 24 hours is to
  	use the time module to measure the elapsed time between 
  two points and compare it with the desired interval. For example:""
import time

interval = 24 * 60 * 60 # 24 hours in seconds
start = time.time() # current time in seconds

# do something ...

end = time.time() # current time in seconds
elapsed = end - start # elapsed time in seconds

if elapsed >= interval:
    # reset the counter and do something else ...
    start = time.time()
"""You can also use the Timer class from the threading module to create a timer that 
  executes a function after a certain interval. For example: """

import threading

interval = 24 * 60 * 60 # 24 hours in seconds

def timeout():
    # do something ...
    print("time out!")

# create a timer that calls timeout after interval seconds
T = threading.Timer(interval, timeout)
T.start()

# cancel the timer if needed
T.cancel()
